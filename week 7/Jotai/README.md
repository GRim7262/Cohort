# Learning Jotai 🧠⚛️

Since [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/) is no longer actively maintained, I've decided to learn [Jotai](https://jotai.org/) – a modern and minimalistic state management library for React, built on atomic design principles.

This repository contains my practice code as I go through the learning process.
